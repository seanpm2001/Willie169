Hi, I’m **@willie169**, or **Willie Shen**, a 17-year-old, 12th grade senior high school student and an amateur developer from Taiwan.<br>
I am the Chef Programing Officer of PythonIsSlowOrg, the former Assistant Professor of the Department of Chinese Classics, the Department of Brain Training, and the Department of Logic of the Zhi-Chan School of the Chinese Classics Culture Education Association of Taiwan, and the former Chief Editor of the CSJ Literature Group.<br>
My best project is Android Non Root: [Website](https://willie169.github.com), [App](https://github.com/Willie169/Android-Non-Root). It's a tutorial exploring a range of powerful, open-source tools such as Termux, Shizuku, Tor, TrackerControl, InviZible Pro, QEMU, Andronix, and OpenSSL to enhancing Android devices’ functionality, security, privacy, and customization without the need for root access.<br>
Some done works of mine are [mancala-android](https://github.com/Willie169/mancala-android), [mancala-cli](https://github.com/Willie169/mancala-cli), and [LaTeX-ToolKit](https://github.com/Willie169/LaTeX-ToolKit).<br>
I am also contributing open source projects like [bython](https://github.com/Willie169/bython) and [grammars-v4](https://github.com/Willie169/grammars-v4) and working with friends on [PISCppLibrary](https://github.com/PythonIsSlowOrg/PISCppLibrary) and [pisDiplomacy](https://github.com/PythonIsSlowOrg/pisDiplomacy).<br>
The languages I used most often are Traditional Chinese (native), English, C/C++, Python, and LaTeX. I am also learning Japanese, Java, JavaScript, Rust, HTML, and CSS.<br>
I am interested in and learning cross-language programming, machine learning, DSA, OS, investment management, and bot trading.<br>
My favorite subjects are computer science and information engineering, electrical engineering, economics, finance, physics, mathematics, and philosophy.<br>
I enjoy playing [webDiplomacy](https://webdiplomacy.net/userprofile.php?userID=222135), Chinese chess (Xiangqi), chess, watching animes, reading books, writing literatures, and coding in my free time.<br>
